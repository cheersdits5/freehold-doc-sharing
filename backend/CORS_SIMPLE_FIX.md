# 🎯 CORS Simple Fix - Final Solution

## 🎉 GREAT PROGRESS!
The frontend is now making API calls to the **correct URL**:
`https://wdjv9gq946.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/api/files`

This means the environment variable fix worked! 

## 🚨 Remaining Issue:
**CORS Error**: `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource`

## 🔧 Simple CORS Fix Applied:

### **Simplified CORS Configuration:**
- Changed from complex origin checking to `origin: true` (allow all)
- Set explicit `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header
- Improved OPTIONS preflight handling

### **Why This Will Work:**
- Removes complex origin validation that might be failing
- Uses the most permissive CORS settings for debugging
- Ensures all required headers are present

## 📦 **URGENT: Upload New Lambda Package**

1. **Go to AWS Lambda Console**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/
2. **Click**: `freehold-api` function
3. **Code tab** → **Upload from** → **.zip file**
4. **Select**: `backend/freehold-api-lambda-CORS-SIMPLE.zip`
5. **Click Save**

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Update:**
- ✅ No more CORS errors
- ✅ GET `/api/files` works (document list loads)
- ✅ POST `/api/files/upload` works (file uploads succeed)
- ✅ Documents appear in the list
- ✅ Files persist in S3

## 🔍 **Test Steps:**
1. **Refresh your website**
2. **Check browser console** - should see API configuration debug info
3. **Try uploading a file** - should work without CORS errors
4. **Check document list** - should show uploaded files

This simplified CORS configuration should finally resolve the upload issues!
