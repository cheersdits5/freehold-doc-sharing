# üö® URGENT: Update Lambda Function to Fix Mock Responses

## The Problem
Your website is still showing "mock-file-" responses and the sample document because the AWS Lambda function hasn't been updated with the real S3 code.

## The Solution
You need to manually update the Lambda function in AWS Console with the new code.

## üìã EXACT STEPS TO FIX THIS:

### Step 1: Access AWS Lambda Console
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/
2. **IMPORTANT**: Make sure you're in the **Europe (London) eu-west-2** region (top right corner)
3. Look for a function named: **freehold-api**

### Step 2: Update the Function Code
1. Click on the **freehold-api** function name
2. In the function overview, click the **Code** tab
3. Click **Upload from** dropdown ‚Üí select **.zip file**
4. Click **Browse** and select: `backend/freehold-api-lambda-FINAL.zip`
5. Click **Save**
6. Wait for "Successfully updated the function freehold-api" message

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables (CRITICAL)
1. Click the **Configuration** tab
2. Click **Environment variables** in the left sidebar
3. Click **Edit** button
4. Add/Update these variables (click **Add environment variable** for each):

```
NODE_ENV = production
AWS_REGION = eu-west-2
S3_BUCKET_NAME = freehold-documents-prod
JWT_SECRET = freehold-jwt-secret-2024-production-key
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET = freehold-refresh-secret-2024-production-key
CORS_ORIGIN = https://main.d2n7j8wrtqbawq.amplifyapp.com
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 52428800
LOG_LEVEL = info
```

5. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Test the Fix
1. Wait 30 seconds for changes to take effect
2. Go to your website: https://main.d2n7j8wrtqbawq.amplifyapp.com/dashboard
3. Try uploading a file
4. Open browser console (F12) and check:
   - Should NOT see "mock-file-" in upload responses
   - Should see real file IDs (UUIDs)
   - Sample document should disappear from the list

## üîç Verification Commands
Run this from your computer to test:
```bash
cd backend
node test-api.js
```

**Before fix**: Shows "mock-file-" and sample document
**After fix**: Shows real UUIDs and empty document list

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If you can't find the Lambda function:
- Make sure you're in **eu-west-2** region
- The function might be named slightly differently
- Look for any function with "freehold" or "api" in the name

### If upload still shows "mock-file-":
- Check that environment variables were saved correctly
- Wait 1-2 minutes for Lambda to restart
- Clear browser cache and try again

### If you get permission errors:
- Make sure you're logged into the correct AWS account
- You need Lambda function update permissions

## üìÅ Files Included:
- `freehold-api-lambda-FINAL.zip` - The deployment package with real S3 functionality
- This replaces ALL mock responses with actual file upload/download

## üéØ Expected Results After Update:
‚úÖ No more "mock-file-" responses
‚úÖ Real file uploads to S3
‚úÖ Sample document disappears
‚úÖ Uploaded files appear in document list
‚úÖ Files persist between page refreshes

This update will finally make your document sharing platform fully functional!
