# 🔧 CORS Fix Instructions

## Good News!
The Lambda function is now running our real code (no more "mock-file-" responses)! But we need to fix the CORS issues.

## 🚨 Issues Identified:
1. **CORS Policy Blocking**: The upload request is being blocked by CORS policy
2. **Network Error**: Related to the CORS blocking

## 🔧 Quick Fix:

### Step 1: Upload Updated Code
1. Go back to AWS Lambda Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/
2. Click on **freehold-api** function
3. Click **Code** tab
4. Click **Upload from** → **.zip file**
5. Select: `backend/freehold-api-lambda-CORS-FIX.zip`
6. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables
Make sure these are still set in **Configuration** → **Environment variables**:
```
CORS_ORIGIN = https://main.d2n7j8wrtqbawq.amplifyapp.com
```

### Step 3: Test Again
1. Wait 30 seconds
2. Try uploading a file again
3. Check browser console for any remaining errors

## 🔍 What I Fixed:
- Added specific CORS support for your exact domain: `https://main.d2n7j8wrtqbawq.amplifyapp.com`
- Added debugging logs to help identify CORS issues
- Improved CORS header handling

## 🎯 Expected Results:
- ✅ No more CORS errors
- ✅ File uploads should work
- ✅ No more "Network Error" messages

If you still see issues after this update, check the browser console and let me know what errors appear!
