# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the authentication issue where users cannot log into the deployed Freehold Document Sharing website. The system currently redirects users back to the login screen after entering credentials because there are no users seeded in the database. This feature will implement proper user seeding and fix any authentication flow issues to ensure admin users can successfully log into the system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to have default admin credentials available in the production database, so that I can log into the deployed website and manage the document sharing system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a default admin user with known credentials
2. WHEN the admin user attempts to log in with the default credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate successfully and redirect to the dashboard
3. WHEN the database migration runs THEN the system SHALL hash the admin password securely using bcrypt
4. IF the admin user already exists THEN the system SHALL not create duplicate users
5. WHEN displaying default credentials THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation of the admin login details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to debug authentication issues in the deployed environment, so that I can identify and fix any problems preventing successful login.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN the frontend makes login requests THEN the system SHALL properly handle API responses and errors
3. WHEN tokens are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure they are valid and properly formatted
4. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
5. WHEN debugging authentication THEN the system SHALL provide tools to verify user existence and password hashes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the authentication system to work correctly in the production environment, so that authorized users can access the document sharing platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users submit valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate and provide access tokens
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL redirect users to the main dashboard
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages without exposing sensitive information
4. IF the production environment has different configurations THEN the system SHALL handle environment-specific settings correctly
5. WHEN the system is deployed THEN the authentication flow SHALL work end-to-end without manual intervention
